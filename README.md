Symfony One File Challenge
==========================

How much code do we need for a functional Symfony application, without
resorting to code golf and unreadable code? That's the main challenge that
started this repository.

Fabien Potencier [blogged][blog] about a challenge he set for himself to
get it down to one file and 200 lines of code in 2013. Unfortunately, we
never got the final result. Now, 10+ years later, can we finish this
challenge?

This repository is a live demo of my blogpost over at:
